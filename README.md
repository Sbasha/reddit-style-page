# reddit-style-page
This is my attempt at using the mean stack to create a reddit style website. Strictly for learning purposes, I'll be following the tutorial on Thinkster.io and adding new things as I learn them.  I will be commenting heavily to further my understanding, if you see anything worded incorrectly please feel free to make changes!
